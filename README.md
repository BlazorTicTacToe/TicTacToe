# TIC TAC TOE

401 Final project by Alex Stoforandov, Kris Riedman, Jamilah McWilliams, Christina Gislason

Project: TicTacToe

## DESCRIPTION

This web app helps users hone their Tic Tac Toe skills against a talented AI opponent.  
This project may appear simple on the surface, but underneath, this app is built using Blazor.
Users are able to play a game of Tic Tac Toe against a computer and store 
the results of their game on the player's account that they registered.

## COMMUNICATION PLAN 

We will communicate after hours and on the weekend by using Slack.
Our strategy for ensuring everyone's voices are heard will be to ask questions. 
We will get input on changes and ideas to our project from the group.
We will also sit near each other so everyone knows what is going on.
We will create a safe environment in our group by always being open to a discussion on 
any issue brought up by a group member.  This combined with our experience working with each 
other will guarantee a smooth project week with very little friction among group members.

## CONFLICT PLAN

When our group encounters conflict we will talk it out or a possibly duel to death. 
The person left standing is the winner, obviously.
We will raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing by asking direct 
questions. Talk to each other, talk through people's strengths and interests and how 
they want to contribute.
Our process to resolve conflicts will be to use stand-ups as an opportunity to voice issues. 
We plan on being open and communicative with each other through the entire project.
We will escalate the conflict if our attempts to mediate are unsuccessful after 15 
minutes of death stares and no progress. Following that, we will seek outside guidance.

## WORK PLAN

We will manage our tasks through Azure DevOps.  This will ensure that there always will be
 a record of who is assigned to what task and when that task is expected to be completed.
  We will come together periodically each day of project week to ensure an equal share of 
  the work is completed by all members of the team. 

## GIT PROCESS

When a team member creates a Pull Request, it must be reviewed by one other person 
who did not work on the code. Pull Requests may be merged by the reviewer. 
 We will merge to master after every feature is completed.  We will verbally announce to the
team that a Pull Request has been merged.  Also, before every feature branch is checked out,
we will pull master to ensure we are working with the most up to date code.
