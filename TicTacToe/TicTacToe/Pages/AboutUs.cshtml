                Kris is an avid gamer and Air Force Veteran.  He grew up in North Dakota and the Air Force decided to send him back. He follows professional
                football and basketball (Go Pack Go!!, Let's Go Bucks). His favorite activities include playing video games, watching movies, and exploring
                faraway places with his wife. Fun fact: Kris has spent a full six months of his life underground.

            <p>
                Christina has a keen eye and appreciation for weird, beautiful things like ice flowers and ferrofluid. She could waste hours of her life searching niche music genres if she wasn’t so busy tending to her Korean-Icelandic-Puerto Rican hybrid babies, and learning to code. As she learns more about software engineering, she too like Elon, is convinced we are probably living in a simulation!
